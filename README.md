# Snippetbox

Snippetbox is the outcome of working through the book [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/)

> You might be wondering things like:
> * Where can I see a concrete example of a real-world web application? 
> * How is it best to structure and organize my code?
> * How do I manage and version control dependencies?
> * And how do I effectively test my web application?

>Let’s Go answers these questions for you — and a whole lot more — helping you get up to speed quickly and saving you months of research and experimentation.
>
>The book walks through the start-to-finish build of a complete working application, helping you to learn by doing. You’ll get practical experience implementing common real-life code patterns, the topics that you’re learning about are put in context, and you’ll end up with a well-structured codebase that you can adapt for your own future work.
